_Our comprehensive developers tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for how to build a Solidity-coded roulette game powered by the public good API3 QRNG oracle service. With this tutorial you will be fully equipped to explore the frontier of blockchain gaming, where quantum unpredictability becomes the standard for fair online games of chance._

## Introduction to Quantum-RNG for True Randomness

In the evolving landscape of blockchain-based gaming, the key to success lies in creating verifiably fair, unbiased, and secure user experiences. The unique challenge for blockchain-based games is the generation of truly random numbers on-chain, a critical factor in creating unpredictable and engaging games.

The API3 QRNG (Quantum-Random Number Generation) oracle service provides developers with the tools needed to achieve a quantum level of randomness within smart contracts, building trust and fairness into a multitude of dApps. This randomness is enabled through the provision of entropy from the measurement of quantum fluctuations, providing what is commonly known as ‘true’ random number generation.

The element of randomness inherent in roulette creates an exciting game of chance. With each spin being independent of the last, predicting the outcome becomes an exciting challenge. This unpredictability underscores the importance of true randomness in games and it’s this principle that we’ll be exploring in the following tutorial.

## Learn How To Integrate Entropy Into Your Smart Contract

In order to demonstrate how to use QRNG in a smart contract, we created a developer’s tutorial that brings to life the classic game of roulette. Named after the French term for “little wheel,” in the game roulette players place bets on a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even. A small ball spun around a rotating wheel ultimately determines the outcome as it gradually loses momentum and falls into one of the numbered slots.

API3 is committed to helping developers learn how to use Web3 technologies. Through this tutorial, developers can learn how to integrate an oracle requester contract into a smart contract, then how to utilize off-chain data within execution. While this demo will provide an end-to-end learning experience on how to use QRNG, this principle can be applied to a host of data types and will help you understand the principles of using oracles in smart contracts.

Starting with an extensive overview of roulette mechanics and the various betting options, the tutorial utilizes Remix IDE to code and deploy the roulette contract. As you code your own game, you will learn how QRNG guarantees unpredictability and fairness.
